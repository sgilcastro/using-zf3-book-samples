Pure PHP Sample
==================================================

This sample demonstrates how to write a simple website *without* a framework. It shows how to:

 * Create the Home page
 * Create the Login page
 * Create the Logout page 
 
## Installation

You need to have Apache 2.4 HTTP server and PHP v.5.6 or later.

Download the sample to your Apache document root directory (for example, `/var/www/html`).
